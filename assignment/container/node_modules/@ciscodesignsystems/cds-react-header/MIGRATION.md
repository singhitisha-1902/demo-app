# Comparison with @ciscodesignsystems/cds-react-header (latest version)

> 1 - `CDSBadge` component renamed to `CDSHeaderBadge`.

> 2 - New prop i.e. `logoLinkProps` is added. ( to avail the `Polymorphic functionality` for CDSHeader logo link )

- <b>Note:</b> The use of `logoLink` & `logoLinkTarget` props in the `CDSHeader` component is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of CDS. Please use `logoLinkProps` instead.
