## Sub-components

|         | MDS | CDS  |
| ------- | --- | ---- |
| Item    | ✅  | ✅   |
| Label   | ✅  | ✅\* |
| Divider | ✅  | ✅\* |
| Menu    | ✅  | ✅\* |

> `Dropdown.Label` and `Dropdown.Divider` have been replaced by `<CDSDropdown.Section label="Label" divider={true}></CDSDropdown.Section>`.
>
> The new Section wrapper has a benefit to clearly identify the Items that belong to a Section of the dropdown. This keeps the semantics of element composition as well as order of items in the component.
>
> `Dropdown.Menu` has been replaced by `CDSDropdown.Submenu` meaning the component triggers a submenu of the current menu.
