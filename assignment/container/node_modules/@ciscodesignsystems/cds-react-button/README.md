# cds-react-button

Buttons communicate action and direct intent. Users select a choice and take action on it in the single
press of a button. Icons that can be pressed are also considered buttons.

## Theming

### Primary

Primary buttons indicate a main action. They are focal actions, and so only one primary button should be used in one section of a page, card, or visual grouping.

### Secondary

Secondary buttons are used for actions of lesser importance, for options, or for infrequently used actions.

### Tertiary (text button)

Tertiary buttons are of lesser importance than secondary buttons. They provide further visual hierarchy in interfaces that are action dense.

### Primary destructive

Primary destruction buttons have the same focal importance as primary buttons. The destructive button style indicates that a button’s actions are risky, such as deletion, authorization, or configurations that would be difficult (or not possible) to change once set.

### Secondary destructive

Secondary destructive buttons are of lesser importance, just as secondary buttons are, but using their actions hold risk.

### Icon-only

Icon-only buttons represent actions with icons instead of text. If the icon is common and well understood, you can use an icon-only button without a text label.

By default, icon-only buttons use tertiary button styles.
Remember that you still need to provide accessibility screen reader text descriptions for icon-only buttons.
Before you use only an icon on a button, make sure what the icon represents is clear and that users can understand the action being performed without a label.

## Usage

### Single Button

```tsx
<CDSButton variant="primary">Button</CDSButton>
```

### Multiple Buttons

If you need to show multiple buttons on the same line, use a button group to ensure that they have correct spacing.

```tsx
<CDSButton.Group>
  <CDSButton variant="primary">First</CDSButton>
  <CDSButton variant="secondary">Seconds</CDSButton>
</CDSButton.Group>
```
